Team 3 is working on the map portion of the project.

We've identified these programming tasks:

 a. fetch a world map from Google, place it in a <div>
 b. lay in coords and data for the display points

And these project tasks:
 a. create a "stage" template set of files for testing our routines. This is like a testing shell 
    and formatted starter fileset.
 b. create test data for the data points. This is so we don't have to figure out how to get the location
    of each user yet (that'll be a different part of the project).

Resources include (more coming from oleg, I think):
