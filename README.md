**Project-2 Description**

We are going to build a web application to track your activity as a helper at WeLearnJS Slack Group, each member who received help from any member, would need to tweet about it to the world, that is the way to say "Thank you‚Äù. Tweet should contain a member-helper and a special hashtag #welearnjs. After that Member-helper and member-suggester will appear on a google map, taking their geo-location into account. Each member will have 2 dots (circular diagrams) displaying certain activity:

 - First dot displaying amount of overall help by that user on projects, will grow in size with each mention
 - Second dot displaying amount of suggested or @mentioned helpers. That way members will have a purpose to tweet. Will also grow in size.

*Simple explanation*

![example](http://i.imgur.com/Xn6lmXP.png)

*Example of a tweet:*
 - Oleg:  @Imanuel helped me on a project-1 at #welearnjs

**What data is needed from every tweet?**
* @nickname of a person who tweeted
* @nickname of a person who helped
* The welearnjs hashtag to filter out needed tweets: #welearnjs

It will be location based so our primary interface will consist of a map showing the location of people who suggested someone as a helper and helpers themselves. Approximate Mockup of data taken from Twitter and projected onto a google map.

Zoom lvl1. Dots presenting members from one country/location, will appear/grow live

Zoom lvl2. Dots presenting group of members(counted) from one location. Maybe for different location - different colors.

Zoom lvl3. Members from one location will be combined into groups, the dot presenting country will also grow in size (addition for next iterations)

**Collaboration process**

* We will use ( https://trello.com/ ), so each team would see what needs to be done.
* We will divide project onto parts and every group will accomplish its (self chosen) tasks in weekly sprints.
* Every team will have a leader, responsible to follow what needs to be done.
* Team leader would choose a day for collaboration, would make a daily check-ups of what was done during the day
* Every team would need to comment their code
* By the end of the week, when teams are done with their parts they can add @craigmr ![code-reviewer](http://i.imgur.com/mXs64t0.png) to a pull request, after that their code will be reviewed. All the discussions/meetups can be arranged after that
* Teams can help each other with ongoing work during the week.
